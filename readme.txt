This repository showcases three Java applications created to demonstrate Java programming skills in areas like security, user interface design, and event handling. The projects included are:

    -Password Generator: Generates secure passwords with customizable settings, allowing users to specify length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).

    -Password Strength Checker: Analyzes and rates password strength based on character variety and length, providing feedback to users on improving security.

    -Calculator: A simple, user-friendly calculator for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) designed using Java Swing.

Project Features

Password Generator:
    $Customizable password length and character composition.
    $Easy-to-use interface with clear prompts for password customization.
    $Randomly generates secure passwords suitable for various accounts.

Password Strength Checker:
    $Analyzes password strength based on length and character mix.
    $Categorizes passwords as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong."
    $Simple, efficient code design for quick strength analysis.

Calculator:
    $Basic arithmetic functions with error handling.
    $Intuitive layout with buttons for each operation.
    $Displays results clearly, handling division errors gracefully.
